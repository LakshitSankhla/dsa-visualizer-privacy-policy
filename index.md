# Privacy Policy
**DSA Visualizer**

**Effective Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Last Updated:** March 1, 2026

## 1. Overview

DSA Visualizer is an educational app for learning data structures and algorithms through interactive visualizations.

We do not require account creation. Most app data is stored locally on your device.

## 2. Data We Process

### 2.1 Data Stored Locally on Your Device
- Learning progress and completion status
- App settings and preferences
- Bookmarks and related in-app state
- Personal notes you write against individual algorithms (free-text, stored locally only)

This local data is used only to provide app features and personalization inside the app.

### 2.2 Advertising Data (Google AdMob)

We use Google AdMob to show ads in the free version of the app.  
When ads are enabled, Google may process data such as:
- Advertising ID (or similar device identifiers)
- Device/app information
- Approximate location inferred from IP address
- Ad interaction and performance events

AdMob data processing is governed by Google policies:
- https://policies.google.com/privacy
- https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543

## 3. Consent and Ad Controls

Depending on region and applicable law, the app may request consent for ad personalization and ad data processing before requesting ads.

You can control ads by:
- Using **Settings > Privacy & Ads > Ad privacy options** (where available)
- Managing ad preferences at the device/account level

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell your personal data.

We share limited data only as needed to operate the app, primarily with:
- Google AdMob (advertising)

## 5. Data Retention

- Local app data remains on your device until you reset app data or uninstall.
- Ad-related data is retained by Google based on Google's own retention policies.

## 6. Security

We use platform-provided protections and standard app security practices. No method of storage/transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure.

## 7. Children

This app is intended for general educational use. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided information in a way that should be removed, contact us.

## 8. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding access, deletion, objection, or restriction of data processing.

Because most app data is local, you can remove it directly by resetting in-app data or uninstalling the app.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy when app features, legal requirements, or third-party integrations change. Updates will be reflected by the **Last Updated** date.
